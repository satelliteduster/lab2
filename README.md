blue pong
- pong, but its blue, and it just gets bluer
- as the player bounces the ball against the ceiling, it gets more blue
- against a blue background, the game gets progressively more difficult as the player struggles to see the ball
- oddly enough, partially inspired by the movie 'blue' by derek jarman (high recommend) in which the screen is awash with a stark blue and everything else is audiovisual (unlike this game, which is fully visual)
- the blue ball does have a slightly dark shadow to allow players to have a fighting chance [albeit by straining their eyes]
